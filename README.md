_Alternative file explorer for PC_

An alternative to Windows Explorer focused on organisation and situational awareness. Inspired by the Miller columns design (most notable in Appleâ€™s Mac OSX Finder). The program remains minimalist with strong extensibility available planned for power users. My aim with this project is to figure out what annoys me most about Windows Explorer and find a solution.
